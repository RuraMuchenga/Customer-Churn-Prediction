# Customer-Churn-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using various machine learning models in Python, including logistic regression, random forests, and gradient boosting, with the scikit-learn library. By analyzing historical customer data, the project aims to identify key factors contributing to customer churn, enabling businesses to implement targeted strategies to retain customers.

The project involves comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Pandas and Matplotlib to uncover patterns and trends in customer behavior. Data pipelines are designed to clean, preprocess, and transform the data, addressing missing values, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical variables to enhance model accuracy.

The final output includes predictive analytics to identify at-risk customers, offering actionable insights for personalized retention strategies.
